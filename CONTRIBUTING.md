# Contributing

## General Guidelines

When submitting a pull request (PR), please use the following
guidelines:

-   Make sure your code respects existing formatting conventions. In
    general, follow the same coding style as the code that you are
    modifying.
-   Do add/update documentation appropriately for the change you are
    making.
-   If you are introducing a new feature you may want to first submit
    your idea for feedback to the [Confluent mailing
    list](mailto:dev@zeelos.io).
-   Non-trivial features should include unit tests covering the new
    functionality.
-   Bugfixes should include a unit test or integration test reproducing
    the issue.
-   Try to keep pull requests short and submit separate ones for
    unrelated features, but feel free to combine simple bugfixes/tests
    into one pull request.
-   Keep the number of commits small and combine commits for related
    changes.
-   Each commit should compile on its own and ideally pass tests.
-   Keep formatting changes in separate commits to make code reviews
    easier and distinguish them from actual code changes.

## GitHub Workflow

1.  Fork the confluentinc/cp-docker-images repository into your GitHub
    account

    > <https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-docker-images/fork>

2.  Clone your fork of the GitHub repository

    ```
    $ git clone <git@github.com>:\<username\>/cp-docker-images.git
    ```

    > Note: replace \<username\> with your GitHub username.

3.  Add a remote to keep up with upstream changes
    
    ```
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-docker-images.git
    ```

    > If you already have a copy, fetch upstream changes

    ```
    git fetch upstream
    ```

4.  Create a feature branch to work in

    ```
    $ git checkout -b feature-xxx remotes/upstream/master
    ```

5.  Work in your feature branch

    ```
    $ git commit -a
    ```

6.  Periodically rebase your changes

    ```
    $ git pull \--rebase
    ```

7.  When done, combine (\"squash\") related commits into a single one

    ```
    $ git rebase -i upstream/master
    ```
    >
    > This will open your editor and allow you to re-order commits and merge
    > them: - Re-order the lines to change commit order (to the extent
    > possible without creating conflicts) - Prefix commits using s (squash)
    > or f (fixup) to merge extraneous commits.

8.  Submit a pull-request

    ```
    $ git push origin feature-xxx
    ```
    >
    > Go to your cp-docker-images fork main page
    
    ``` 
    <https://github.com/>\<username\>/cp-docker-images
    ```
    >
    > If you recently pushed your changes GitHub will automatically pop up a
    > Compare & pull request button for any branches you recently pushed to.
    > If you click that button it will automatically offer you to submit
    > your pull-request to the confluentinc/cp-docker-images repository.
    >
    > -   Give your pull-request a meaningful title.
    > -   In the description, explain your changes and the problem they are
    >     solving.

9.  Addressing code review comments

    > Repeat steps 5. through 7. to address any code review comments and
    > rebase your changes if necessary.
    >
    > Push your updated changes to update the pull request
    >
    ```
    $ git push origin \[\--force\] feature-xxx
    ```
    >
    > --force may be necessary to overwrite your existing pull request in
    > case your commit history was changed when performing the rebase.
    >
    > Note: Be careful when using \--force since you may lose data if you
    > are not careful.
    >
    ```
    $ git push origin \--force feature-xxx
    ```
